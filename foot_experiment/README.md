[FOOT (FragmentatiOn Of Target)](https://web.infn.it/foot/) is an applied nuclear physics experiment conceived to conduct high-precision cross section measurements of nuclear fragmentation processes relevant for [particle therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_therapy) and [radiation protection in space](https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/space_radiation_ebook.pdf). These measurements are important to estimate the physical and biological effects of nuclear fragments, which are produced when energetic particle beams penetrate human tissue.

## Goal of FOOT

The goal of the FOOT (FragmentatiOn Of Target) experiment is to measure **double differential cross sections** (in fragment kinetic energy and direction) for nuclear fragmentation processes induced by beams impinging on targets, that are of interest for particle therapy.

## FOOT applications

### Hadrontherapy

Hadrontherapy is a very advanced form of radiotherapy. **Radiotherapy**, alone or associated with surgery and / or chemotherapy, improves local control in various tumor pathologies.

The strength of hadrontherapy resides in the unique physical and radiobiological properties of the **charged** **particles** (hadrons): they can penetrate the tissues with little diffusion and deposit maximum energy just before stopping. This allows the region to be irradiated to be defined very **precisely**. The characteristic peak shape of the energy deposit is called the [Bragg peak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bragg_peak) and has become the symbol of hadrontherapy.

### Space Travel 

One of the biggest obstacles to **space travel** is the large amount of **radiation** present outside the atmosphere, which would pose a serious risk to both the crew and the electronics. The data provided by FOOT can be used to develop **cosmic radiation protection systems** aboard space shuttles.
