# What is Emacs?


- Emacs is an editor available in **UNIX**.
- Like vi, emacs is a **screen editor**.
- Commands in emacs are either control characters (hold down the  `<Ctrl>` key while typing another character) or are prefixed by one of a set of reserved characters: ` <Esc>` or ` <Ctrl>-X`.
- To use emacs on a file, type    `emacs <filename>`.
