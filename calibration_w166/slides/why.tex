		\begin{itemize}
			\item Basically the problem is that the amplitude value [mV] on the PC display and the trigger value are not the same
			\item There is a slight difference between them that needs to be calibrated
			\item A good knowledge of the trigger value is required to be able to trigger between the various fragments
		\end{itemize}
