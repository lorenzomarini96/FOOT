|     **WaveDAQ**  |  WaveDAQ is a digitization **Trigger and Data AcQuisition system** (TDAQ) allowing Multi-gigasample **waveform** recording on a large amount of channels (up to 16384) by using the **DRS4** analog switched capacitor array as downconverting **ASIC**. |[DAQ](https://github.com/lorenzomarini96/FOOT/blob/main/appendix/figures/daq/wavedream.pdf") |
|     **WaveDREAM**  |  Waveform Drs4 REadout Module (WaveDREAM) is a boards contains two **DRS4** chips, capable of 0.5-5 GSPS sampling speeds, together with 900MHz band-width variable gain amplifiers to allow direct connection of detector signals. |DAQ   |
