|     **WaveDAQ**  |  WaveDAQ is a digitization **Trigger and Data AcQuisition system** (TDAQ) allowing Multi-gigasample **waveform** recording on a large amount of channels (up to 16384) by using the **DRS4** analog switched capacitor array as downconverting **ASIC**. |[DAQ](https://github.com/lorenzomarini96/FOOT/blob/main/appendix/figures/daq/wavedream.pdf) |
|     **WaveDREAM**  |  Waveform Drs4 REadout Module (WaveDREAM) is a boards contains two **DRS4** chips, capable of 0.5-5 GSPS sampling speeds, together with 900MHz band-width variable gain amplifiers to allow direct connection of detector signals. |[DAQ](https://github.com/lorenzomarini96/FOOT/blob/main/appendix/figures/daq/wavedream.pdf)   |
|     **DCB**  |  analog switched capacitor array. | [DAQ](https://github.com/lorenzomarini96/FOOT/blob/main/appendix/figures/daq/dcb.png)  |
|     **TCB**  |  The Trigger Concentrator Board (TCB) receives all trigger informations from the WaveDREAMs using low-latency serial links to generate a shared trigger signal when amplitude and time based algorithms detect an event of interest. |DAQ   |
|     **FPGA**  |  field-programmable gate array (FPGA) is an integrated circuit designed to be configured by a customer or a designer after manufacturing â€“ hence the term field-programmable. . |DAQ   |
|     **ASIC**  |  An application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) is an integrated circuit (IC) chip customized for a particular use, rather than intended for general-purpose use. |DAQ   |
|     **Waveform**  |  A varying voltages, currents, or electromagnetic fields. The waveform of an electrical signal can be visualized in an oscilloscope or any other device that can capture and plot its value at various times. |DAQ   |
